Gomaps
======

A really naive toolbox for preparing data for Google Maps applications:

* Polyline
  Transform an array of coordinates into a polyline encoded string.


Polyline
--------

* Encode
  Takes an array of (latitude,longitude) floats and generate a string
  encoding a polyline ready to be used with Google Maps.

This is loosely based on Joel Rosenberg's ruby implementation of the
encoder. It is licensed under the same terms as Ruby.
